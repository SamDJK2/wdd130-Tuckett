    <h2>Client Report</h2>
    <p>The project, in my eyes, was a success. I am not sure how you feel about how it turned out but it fits pretty well with the wirefream given.
        Much of the colors seemed very bright and vibrant. I wonder how you feel about this page. Hopefully you will say that it exceeded your expectations.
        Each link on the header works appropriatly (aside from the logo which is not a link), however I did not think to ask for twitter, facebook, or instagram links
        as I deemed it unneccisary for this assignment. I and my junior developers (hopefully) worked hard and are glad with how things turned out, and we hope you are satisfied.
